	}
==> Key value Pair of data.
==JSON FORMAT OF DATA IN TERMS OF ARRAY======
[
	{
	     "name":"Alok",
              "class":"Node js"
	},
	{
	     "name":"Alok",

console.log(os.platform());
o/p-win32/...

-TO know the how many cpus are working in the machine
2.console.log(os.cpus());
o/p-..

-To know the architecture of the computer.
3.console.log(os.arch());

o/p-x64

-To know the length of the cpus

4.console.log(os.cpus().length);
o/p-4

-To know more go for os.(So many options are there)
